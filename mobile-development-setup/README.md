# Mobile Development Setup â€” Expo (React Native)

Objective

- Prepare your machine and physical device to run React Native apps using Expo Go for a smooth development and testing experience.

Prerequisites

- Node.js LTS installed
- VS Code (recommended)
- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- A physical Android or iOS device with Expo Go installed

Why Expo Go?

- Saves time and hardware cost by running apps on a real device.
- Supports iOS and Android without building native binaries for each change.
- Fast iteration: scan a QR code or open a project link to preview your app.

Install Expo Go

1. Open https://expo.dev/go and select the latest SDK.
2. Install Expo Go:
   - Android: Google Play Store
   - iOS: Apple App Store
3. Open Expo Go on your device and sign in or create an account.

Quick verification

1. On your dev machine run: expo start
2. In Expo Dev Tools, scan the displayed QR code with Expo Go (or open the provided link).
3. Confirm the example project loads on your device.

Document your setup

- Record OS, Node.js version, VS Code version, Expo SDK used.
- Note steps performed and any issues encountered (errors, network or USB debugging steps).
- Add troubleshooting notes so you can reproduce fixes later.

Troubleshooting tips

- Enable USB debugging (Android) if QR scanning fails and use tunnel/lan options.
- Ensure device and dev machine are on the same network for LAN.
- Update Expo Go and the Expo CLI when facing compatibility issues.
